# Documentation

This repository now separates documentation into two tracks:

- [Usage Documentation](usage/README.md) for consumers of the library
- [Internal Documentation](internal/README.md) for architecture, contracts, and development plans

If you're trying to use the library, start with usage docs.
If you're changing internals, specs, or factory behavior, use internal docs.
